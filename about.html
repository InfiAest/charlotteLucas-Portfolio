                <h1>About me.</h1>
                <p class="boldText">I'm Charlotte. A front-end developer from the UK but based in Bergen, Norway.</p>

                <p>After studying CGI & VFX for a couple of years and working on farms, I moved to 
                    Bergen when I was 22 and started to take some language classes and work in bars. 
                    Working in bars helped me to meet a wide variety of people and learn about what 
                    web development was through them. It also helped me a lot to develop my language 
                    skills and communicate well in Norwegian.</p>

                <p>When I found out about the front-end development course with Noroff I was thrilled 
                    that I had finally found something that I felt I could really immerse myself in 
                    and enjoy.</p>

        <div class="container2">
            <div class="text-container">
                
                    
                <div class="scrollingContainer show-on-scroll">
                    <p class="scroll-text boldText">I really enjoy being creative, but I am a logical thinker, so I feel very at home 
                        with front-end development. I get to build beautiful websites using code and 
                        problem solving.</p>
                </div>

                <p>I love cooking, reading, learning, photography, gaming, animals, trying new things 
                    and all things fantasy. I like technical finicky little things which currently has 
                    my other half teaching me how to play golf in my spare time. It's not just hitting 
                    a ball like I first thought. In fact, it's really hard to hit the ball at all when 
                    you start!</p>

                <p>When I'm not searching for the British spelling of colour in my CSS, you can usually 
                    find me out walking my dog and taking photos of him, finishing a puzzle that's taken 
                    up all the space on my dining table or watching Lord of the Rings again.</p>

                <p>Through my studies at Noroff I have learnt how to use a variety of technology and 
                    gained a lot of front-end development skills. Some of the technology I have learnt 
                    to use include Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for designing and 
                    JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, SASS, WordPress API and Strapi API for developing 
                    websites.</p>
